# Discord Clients

There are actually lots of different clients for Discord - ranging in stability.

## Stable

This is probably the Discord you’re using. It’s the version ready for public use.

## PTB

The Public Test Build is a publicly available beta of discord for testing for bugs.

## Canary

Canary gets new features a lot earlier but is a bit less stable. It is required to use Powercord.

## Development

This client is used internally for developing Discord. It has all experiments enabled. Mods like Powercord can enable these on Canary too.

NOTE: ENABLING EXPERIMENTS OR USING THE DEV CLIENT *CAN GET YOUR ACCOUNT BANNED*. MAKE SURE TO READ THIS WARNING FROM THE POWERCORD DEV TEAM REGARDING EXPERIMENTS:
